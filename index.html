        <h3>Fulidhoo Island Guide: Shark & Stingray Beach In Maldives</h3>
        <p>Fulidhoo is a small, budget-friendly local island we visited recently in the Maldives, along with Dhigurah island, which we loved for its beaches and sandbar.Aside from scuba diving, the prime attraction in Fulidhoo is the shark and stingray beach, where you can see nurse sharks, sea turtles, and stingrays in the shallow water and even get your picture taken with them.</p>
