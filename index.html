        <h3>Fulidhoo Island Guide: Shark & Stingray Beach In Maldives</h3>
        <p>Fulidhoo is a small, budget-friendly local island we visited recently in the Maldives, along with Dhigurah island, which we loved for its beaches and sandbar.Aside from scuba diving, the prime attraction in Fulidhoo is the shark and stingray beach, where you can see nurse sharks, sea turtles, and stingrays in the shallow water and even get your picture taken with them.</p>

        <h3>How To Get To Fulidhoo Island</h3>
        <p>Thereâ€™s no airport in Fulidhoo, so you first have to fly into the capital of the Maldives at Male International Airport (MLE), which is about 55 kilometers (35 miles) from Fulidhoo.From Male, you can take a speedboat or ferry directly to Fulidhoo.</p>
